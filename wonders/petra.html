    <h1>The Petra</h1>
    <p>Petra is a historical and archaeological city in southern Jordan. It is famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit system. Petra is also known as the "Rose City" due to the color of the stone from which it is carved. Established possibly as early as 312 BC as the capital city of the Nabataeans, it is a symbol of Jordan, as well as Jordan's most-visited tourist attraction.</p>
    <p>The site remained unknown to the Western world until 1812, when it was introduced by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt. Petra has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1985. UNESCO has described it as "one of the most precious cultural properties of man's cultural heritage".</p>
    <p>Petra lies on the slope of Jebel al-Madhbah (identified by some as the biblical Mount Hor) in a basin among the mountains which form the eastern flank of Arabah (Wadi Araba), the large valley running from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba. Petra is a major tourist attraction, and tourism is the main source of income for the local economy.</p>
