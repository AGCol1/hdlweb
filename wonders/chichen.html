            <h1>Chichen Itza</h1>
            <p>Chichen Itza is a large pre-Columbian archaeological site built by the Maya civilization located in the
                Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico. It is one of the most visited archaeological sites in Mexico and was
                designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1988.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Chichen Itza was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late Classic (c. AD 600–900)
                through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800–900) and into the early portion of the Postclassic period (c. AD
                900–1200). The site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central
                Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands.</p>

            <h2>Main Attractions</h2>

                    is the most iconic structure at Chichen Itza. It was built to honor the feathered serpent god,
                    Kukulcan.</li>
                <li><strong>The Great Ball Court:</strong> The largest and most impressive ball court in ancient

                    columns depicting warriors.</li>

            <h2>Significance</h2>
            <p>Chichen Itza is considered one of the New Seven Wonders of the World due to its historical, cultural, and
                architectural significance. It provides valuable insights into the Maya civilization and their advanced
